This is a sample solution to the Day 3 assignment.

TODO - stuff I am confused with:
  * using promises versus await() in Airport.js
  * could we use the fs.promises API instead of creating our own Promise?
  * how to run tests in debug mode
  * Parameter deconstructing versus just pass in (Passenger)
  * is it ok to list fields in classes? like Java
  * this.constructor.airports - don't understand this logic
