This is a sample solution to the Day 1 assignment - create a family tree.

We use ES6 syntex to declare a Person class and export this class so that it can be used in the index.html file.

The Person class has been documented using JSDoc.

TODO - work out why we use `export default` and `import` in this Day 1 solution and `module.exports` and `require` in Day 2.
