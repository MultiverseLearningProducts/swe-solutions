This is a sample solution to the Day 2 assignment - add a unit test to test the Person class.

The Person class has been documented using JSDoc.

TODO - stuff I am confused with:
  * work out why we use `export default` and `import` in the Day 1 solution and `module.exports` and `require` in Day 2.
  * how to run tests in debug mode
  * Parameter deconstructing versus just pass in (Passenger)
  * is it ok to list fields in classes? like Java
